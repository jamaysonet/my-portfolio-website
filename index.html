  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am a Front End developer and someone who loves to learn. I have, over the past couple of years, learned a few progamming languages in order to expand my knowledge and become a more proficient developer.  
  <p> What&rsquo;s important to me is being able to complete any challenge given to me and to prove that I can do what is needed in a timely manner. The experience of being able to learn while working and pushing myself to a new level of understanding and proving that I am capable of handling whatever projects I am assigned to.<p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I was born in the Dominican Republic which is a beautiful island in the Carreabeans.  My mother decided to move to the United States in order to give my brother and I a better life.  I have lived in Rhode Island, New York, North Carolina, and Texas.  I got out of the military in 2016 after sic years of service and am currently working on achieving my goal of becoming a developer because it is something that I find exciting and I love the challenges that come along with it. I am currently also working on my Software Engineering degree, which I placed on hold while doing the Web developpment program through Thinkful.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I really enjoy reading about space exploration and about new advances in science.  I also really love gaming but have been unable to do to much of it because of my one year old.  He requires a lot of attention and will stop at nothing to get it.  Sometimes even going so far as to jump in on some games with me, of course his controller is off, but he doesn't know that.  I also enjoy playing with my kids and helping them learn.</p>
  <h2>What&rsquo;s your dream job?</h2>
  <p>My dream job would be a job where I get to not only work as a programmer but be a mentor to others and teach others how to be proficient in what they do.  I would also love to be able to work with virtual reality systems one day as well, as I find that to be an amazing field and see it as something that will expand exponentially not only in gaming but in all fields of study.</p>
  <h2>What&rsquo;s your background?</h2>
  <p>I have experience with C#, Microsoft SQL, HTML, CSS3, and javascript.  I first got into programming by doing a 16 week course through the Military called the Microsoft and Systems Academy.  This program was rigorous and thaught me what it takes to be a programmer as well as how to implement the software development life cycle throuhgout the course.  I fell in love with coding and at times felt like I hated it.  When I would reach a wall, I felt like giving up but would not.  I would use stack overflow, google, and the help of class mates and when I would finally figure out the issue, it felt like I had just accomplished so much and I enjoy that feeling.</p>
  <h2>What drives you?</h2>
  <p>I am passionate about learning and find that my wife and kids are what drive me.  They push me to want to learn more and build upon myself so that I can show them that with effort and a great mentality anything can be achieved.</p>
